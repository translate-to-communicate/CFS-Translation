 - Added 2 functions "call" and "col_edit" which reduces the overall space of the "main" function
 - Removed excess comments

 - Fixed an issue where if the user did not give the agency an updated name the new file extension was added </br> on top of the old file extension (e.g., .xlsx became .xlsx.csv)
